# Overview

My answer to the coding challenge. To run this project please type: node app.js into the terminal after opening.

### Task 1

In task 1 I assigned the prices of products to variables, and found the total. I then assigned these to the correct Order ID to create a new array/csv.

### Task 2

In task 2 I paired the product ID with each customer ID who purchased that item.

### Task 3

In task 3 I created an array/csv that shows Id, First Name, Last Name, and total amount (euros) spent in descending order.

Basic javascript/node app. Example (incomplete)code for client-side download via website/browser available in comments.
